Seattle Robbery Trends
======================

Robbery Trends
--------------

The Seattle dataset was used based on the data provided for the course on [GitHub] (https://github.com/uwescience/datasci_course_materials/tree/master/assignment6).  An analysis of the date was conducted to determine if the number of robberies have significant changes based on the month or day of week.   Also, an analysis was compared to the hour the offence was reported compared to all offense types, to determine if robberies have a unique hourly trend. 

The below image shows how robberies in Seattle based on the month and day of week.

### Conclusion
Although a lot was learned in terms of setting up GitHub, Windows 10 on Virtual Box and attempting to use Tableau, I do not believe I have analysed and presented any meaningful conclusions.
